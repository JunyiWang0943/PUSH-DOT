Push Dot is a traditional Chinese mahjong game, and its simple rules and convenient operation make many people willing to try this game.

The game props needed include one to nine dots (represented by 1-9 in the code), four whiteboards (represented by '' in the code), a total of 40 pieces, 2 dice, and 4 players. 

At the beginning of the game, roll the dices and determine who to start playing cards from based on the remainder obtained by dividing the dice by 4 (for example, if the remainder is 0, player 1 will start playing cards. If the remainder is 1, player 2 will start playing cards, and so on).

In each round of the game, each player will randomly receive two cards from them until the end of the entire game. The cards that have already been played will not be recycled until 40 cards are played and the entire game ends. At this time, the 40 cards will be randomly recoded and wait for the start of the next game. 

The method of determining victory or defeat is to compare the size of the cards each player holds in their hand. The specific rules for winning or losing are as follows:
1. Two cards with the same point are called pairs; Two cards with different points, the remainder of 10 obtained by adding the points together is called a point; The sum of the points of two cards is 10, which is recorded as 0 points.
2. Each pair of cards, from large to small: pairs>points>0 points. Similar cards are counted based on points, with larger points winning smaller points.
3. If there are multiple players with the same number of points, the difference between the points of the two cards is taken, and the player with the larger number wins (for example, if the sum of the points of both cards is 9, player one is 1 and 8, and player two is 2 and 7, then player one wins)
4. The whiteboard is equivalent to 0.5 points when counting points. The whiteboard pair is the largest pair, greater than all other pairs
5. If a player obtains both 2 and 8 at the same time, this situation is considered a special case and will not be counted as 0 points, but will be recorded as the largest card type, greater than all other card types. This is the only special card type.
6. After each round of the game, points will be scored. The player with the largest card type will receive 4 points, followed by 3 points, and so on. If the card types are exactly the same (such as both 4 and 5), the same score will be obtained after comparing the sizes (taking the higher value)

This game has more complex rules in the actual operation process, and some rules have been simplified in this project. If you can play this game in real life, please refer to the actual rules. The settings in this project do not have any reference value.
